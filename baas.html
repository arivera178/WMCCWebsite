            <h1>The BAA's</h1>
            <p>
              The Business Achievement Awards (BAA) is a leadership development program for high school students that
              is easy to integrate into your classroom. The cocurricular activities are aligned to the career
              clusters, NBEA standards, and FBLA goals. View the alignments.

              Students enhance their leadership skills, expand their business knowledge, contribute to their local
              communities, and earn recognition by immersing themselves in their school, community, and FBLA programs.
            </p>

            Chapter advisers direct students through each level, while students work at their own pace to
            independently complete projects. There are four levels of the BAA, with each level increasingly
            challenging your high school students to expand their leadership skills and showcase their talents:
            <ul>
              <li>Future</li>
              <li>Business</li>
              <li>Leader</li>
              <li>America</li>
            </ul>
            Each level builds upon previous work, and your students receive recognition when they complete each level.
            Students must be members of the FBLA division.
          </p>
